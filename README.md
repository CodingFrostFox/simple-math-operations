# Corresponding to the programming task in my IT course of studies:
- Implementation of a class (with Gaussian Summation, for-loop, recursion) for solving the Gaussian sum  
  - e.g.: n=3 --> sum = 1+2+3 = 6
- Implementation of anonymous classes and anonymous functions for
    - f1(x) = x - 1; start value 10, target value -10
    - f2(x) = Collatz -->  (f2(x) = x/2 [x is even], f2(x) = 3x + 1 [x is odd]); start value 27, target value 1
